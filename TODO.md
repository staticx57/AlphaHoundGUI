        - ✅ Transuranics (Pu-238/239/240, Np-237, Am-243, Cm-244)
    - ✅ Settings panel (⚙️) for threshold customization (isotope min confidence, chain min confidence, peak matching tolerance)
    - ✅ localStorage persistence across sessions
- [x] **Decay Chain Detection**:
    - ✅ Identify typical radioactive decay chains in detected spectra
    - ✅ When daughter products are detected, suggest likely parent isotopes
    - ✅ U-238 chain (Pa-234m, Th-234, Ra-226, Pb-214, Bi-214, etc.)
    - ✅ U-235 chain (Actinium series with abundance weighting)
    - ✅ Th-232 chain (Tl-208, Ac-228, Pb-212, etc.)
    - ✅ Visual display of detected chain members with confidence levels
    - ✅ Authoritative source links (NNDC, IAEA, LBNL, USGS, NRC)
- [x] **Natural Abundance Weighting**:
    - ✅ Research-based isotopic abundance from LBNL/NRC
    - ✅ U-238 (99.3%) correctly ranks above U-235 (0.72%) in natural samples
    - ✅ Intermediate filtering layer between detection and thresholding
- [x] **Stability Fixes**:
    - ✅ Fix persistent serial disconnection issues (killed zombie processes, simplified serial loop).
    - ✅ Fixed real-time acquisition timer overshoot (300/300 exact)
    - ✅ Fixed PDF export Content-Disposition header for proper downloads
- [x] **Deployment Improvements**:
    - ✅ Remove virtual environment requirement
    - ✅ Create simplified one-click launch process
    - ✅ Support running without AlphaHound device connected
- [x] **Refactor threshold filtering to application layer**:
    - ✅ Moved confidence threshold filtering from `isotope_database.py` to `main.py`
    - ✅ `identify_isotopes()` and `identify_decay_chains()` return ALL matches
    - ✅ Application layer applies filtering based on Simple/Advanced mode
    - ✅ Runtime threshold adjustment without modifying core detection logic

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced ML Integration**:
    - Integrate `PyRIID` for machine-learning based isotope identification.
    - *Note: Requires Python < 3.11 (Incompatible with current 3.13 env)*
- [ ] **Custom Isotope Definitions**:
    - Allow users to add custom isotopes to the database via UI
    - Import/export custom isotope libraries
- [ ] **Energy Calibration UI**:
    - Interactive peak marking for calibration
    - Multi-point linear/quadratic calibration
- [ ] **Background Subtraction**:
    - Load background spectrum and subtract from samples
    - Improves detection of weak sources
- [ ] **UI Icon Polish**:
    - Replace all emoji icons with professional SVG/PNG assets
    - Icons needed: 📜 History, ⚙️ Settings, 🌓 Theme, 🔌 Device, 🔄 Refresh, ▶️ Play, ⏹️ Stop, 📂 Upload, 📄 PDF, 📊 Compare, 🔬 Analysis, 🚀 Rocket
    - Add favicon to browser tab
    - Consistent icon styling across all buttons

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add unit tests for the frontend javascript.
- [ ] Add unit tests for backend API endpoints
- [x] ✅ Refactor `main.py` to move CSV handling logic into its own module `csv_parser.py` or similar.

- [x] **v2.0 Analysis Robustness (Completed)**:
    - ✅ **Robust Upload Support**: Implemented `UPLOAD_SETTINGS` (1% confidence, 30keV tolerance) for CSV/N42 uploads.
    - ✅ **Dual-Mode Engine**: Live Acquisition uses Strict settings (30%) to filter U-235; Uploads use Robust settings.
    - ✅ **UI Fixes**: Resolved metadata text overlap with CSS `word-break`.
    - ✅ **Verified**: Confirmed correct filtering of U-235 (7% weighted) vs U-238 (53% weighted) in live data.
