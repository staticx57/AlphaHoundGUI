## Web Version

View my web app at [Gamma Spectroscopy Web Demo](https://www.shawnpickett.tech/alphahound)

## Overview

This Python toolkit provides a robust, modern desktop GUI interface for controlling, acquiring, and logging gamma spectroscopy data using the [RadView Detection AlphaHound](https://www.radviewdetection.com/) device. The application supports live dose rate display, manual and automated gamma spectrum acquisition, dose rate logging, and timed spectrum acquisitions - bringing lab-grade usability to your PC, inspired by the official [web demo](https://www.radviewdetection.com/alphaview).

**Key Features:**
- Live dose rate display and logging (CSV and N42 export)
- Manual command entry
- Gamma spectrum acquisition, display, and CSV/N42 export
- Timed spectrum (&quot;count time&quot;) data acquisition (with abort/resume)
- Automated (&quot;Auto Gamma&quot;) spectrum polling
- Full spectrum plotting (matplotlib)
- UI/UX and device command structure faithfully modeled after the original web application

## Getting Started

**Hardware:**  
- [AlphaHound](https://www.radviewdetection.com/) gamma spectrometer (connected by USB, presenting as a serial port)

**Software Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or later
- [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- Tkinter (Standard with most Python installations)

**Installation**

```bash
python -m pip install pyserial matplotlib
```

**Run:**

```bash
python alphahound_gui.py
```

## Usage

1. Connect your [AlphaHound](https://www.radviewdetection.com/) to your computer.
2. Launch the Python application.
3. Select the correct serial port and click **Connect**.
4. Use the GUI to:
    - View and log live dose rate readings
    - Download/clear gamma spectrum at any time
    - Perform **timed counts** (set minutes, start, and optionally abort/stop early)
    - Perform **automated periodic spectrum acquisition** (&quot;Auto Gamma View&quot;)
    - Export dose and spectrum data as CSV or N42 files for further analysis
5. All controls are mutually exclusive: only one spectrum acquisition mode active at a time (manual, timed, or auto).

See the [AlphaView online demo](https://www.radviewdetection.com/alphaview) for command/response protocol inspiration.
